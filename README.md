### Latest Changes ###
Work in progress as I try to impose an (unneccessary) class structure into the old dice roller.

### About this repository ###
Another learning project to put classes in action

### What is this repository for? ###

* Selfish history record so I can review the moments when I figured something out.
* People might want to see how a completely non-programmer actually learned to code, since it's hard to un-learn coding knowledge and therefore hard to teach it to other non-programmers because you lose perspective.

### How do I get set up? ###

I'm trying to get a full self-contained build going, but it's not there yet.
